Should take the Payload object, and see if the insurance info in the payload matches with an insurance record in the master list.

What's the schema of the "master list"?

By finding a match, do you mean matching a specific person's insurance record from one source with another?

Even though object structures can be different among sources, is there at least one key value pair that will always be present, such as policy number?
